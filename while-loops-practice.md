# While Loops Practice
----------------------



### Problem: Counting from one number up to a higher number.

##### In this problem, try making a program that will:
- Allow the user to choose two numbers
- If the second number is larger than or equal to the first number, return and error saying "You have entered an invalid set of numbers."
- If the second number is greater than the first, make the program print every value from the first number to the second number using a variable that gets increased every iteration of the while loop.
- It should stop once it reaches the second number.
- Once it finished counting, it should print this message: "I have finished counting. Exiting now." After this, just insert the following code:
```import time
time.sleep(3)
exit()
```
